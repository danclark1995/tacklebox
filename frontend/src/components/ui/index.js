/**
 * TackleBox UI Component Library — Barrel Export
 *
 * Single source of truth for all reusable UI components.
 * All imports should come from '@/components/ui'.
 *
 * Rules:
 * 1. No screen defines its own button, card, or input
 * 2. Consistent prop API: variant, size, disabled, className
 * 3. Design tokens are the single styling source
 * 4. New components go here first, then get used
 */

// Components will be added as they are built in Phase 1A (continued) and 1B+
// Example: export { default as Button } from './Button'
